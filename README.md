# stick-solo

## description
- Simple planning methods for 2D stick-figure free-solo climbing agents.
- This problem is studied under a couple of my projects as listed here.
- `1.gradient_descent_ik` uses gradient descent based approach.
- `2.ceo_rl_and_random_sample_solves` builds on previous one, adding random sample solves and cross-entropy method based rl.
- For more details on a project, just click on it.
