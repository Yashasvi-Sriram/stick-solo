# assumptions
- 2D wall and stick-figure agents (easier orientation representation)
- Circle and line segment obstacles

# stick-figure agent
- A stick-figure agent = rigid links + joints
- Joints = revolute or prismatic

# serial stick-figure agent
- arranged serially
- n links => n joints => n joint variables => n + 1 ends, but only one free end
