# Basics
- [ ] N link agent planning in known environment
- [ ] Spherical obstacles, line segment obstacles
- [ ] Angle bound obstacles, replanning in known environment
- [ ] Unknown environment (note: the milestones can't be sampled they are part of environment)

# Humanize
- [ ] Human link agent
- [ ] Energy spent in some form
- [ ] Gravity
- [ ] Springy limbs

# Environment
- [ ] Slippery holds

# Rendering
- [ ] 3D context (holds, trees, waterfall, lavafall, birds)
- [ ] 3D models for agent links (hands, legs, body and tail)?

# Make a game
- [ ] Multiple such agents trying to catch player
- [ ] Shoot down agent from ground

# Data structures
- [ ] KD tree for finding nearest hold
